# node-fs-extra-cli

A cli wrapper for node-fs-extra. I needed simple file system operations like copy, remove, clean etc. that I can use from the terminal or, via npm scripts. While there are many Nodejs utils that provide this, all are meant to be used as part of your app, and does not have a CLI interface.

From all of the packages I looked at [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) is definitely the best of the bunch so, I decided to write a CLI wrapper for it.

Note: Not all functions are mapped yet so, please feel free to open an issue if there is something you would like supported.

## Install

```
npm install fs-extra-cli
```

## Usage

For all functions there are two usage options. The first is to simply execute the command and follow the prompts. The second option is to specify the required arguments via command line parameters.

### Copy files or folders

From the fs-extra repo:

"Copy a file or directory. The directory can have contents. Like cp -r."

*Follow the prompts*

```
fsys task=copy
```

*Power user style*

```
fsys task=copy --filesFolders=one,two,three --destination=folder --clobber='false' --preserveTimestamps='false'
```

### Creating directories

From the fs-extra repo:

"Creates a directory. If the parent hierarchy doesn't exist, it's created. Like mkdir -p."

*Follow the prompts*

```
fsys task=mkdir
```

*Power user style*

```
fsys task=mkdir --dir=some/folder
```

### Cleaning directories

From the fs-extra repo:

"Ensures that a directory is empty. Deletes directory contents if the directory is not empty. If the directory does not exist, it is created. The directory itself is not deleted."

*Follow the prompts*

```
fsys task=emptyDir
```

*Power user style*

```
fsys task=emptyDir --dir=some/folder
```

### Deleting directories

From the fs-extra repo:

"Removes a file or directory. The directory can have contents. Like rm -rf."

*Follow the prompts*

```
fsys task=remove
```

*Power user style*

```
fsys task=remove --fileFolder=some/folder
```
